Project Structure :
This repository is organized into two branches to separate the frontend and backend components of the application:

Main Branch: Contains the frontend code, including all user interface elements and client-side logic. This is the default branch where the primary user-facing aspects of the application are developed and maintained.

Second Branch (Backend): Houses the backend code, including server-side logic, APIs, and database integration. This branch is dedicated to handling the application's data processing and communication with external systems.

Please ensure you're working in the appropriate branch for the component you want to modify or deploy.
